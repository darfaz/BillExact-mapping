"""
API: Categorise Activity
=======================

This endpoint accepts a JSON payload with a single ``text`` field
representing a freeâ€‘form description of a legal activity (for
example, a document title or email subject). It returns a JSON
response containing the suggested UTBMS task and activity codes along
with a confidence score between 0 and 1. If no suitable mapping is
found, both codes are returned as ``null`` and the confidence score
reflects the best match (if any). This API is used by the web UI
(`pages/categorize_test.py`) and can also be called by external
clients via the MCP server.

Example request:

```json
{
  "text": "Draft motion for summary judgment"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "task_code": "L240",
  "activity_code": "A103",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "description": "Draft motion for summary judgment"
}
```
